to public lands by trespassing on private property. Never assume access, always seek permission!</p>

<p><strong><span class="text-uppercase">Note:</span></strong> The ratings for these trails are based on a subjective comparison of trails
within this system only. Newcomers are encouraged to begin their riding experience on a "beginner" trail. This will establish a base for
moving onto an "intermediate" or "expert" trail segment. Riders assume all risk associated with skill level, trail difficulty, and conditions.
